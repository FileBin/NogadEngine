 *  \brief Masked Occlusion Culling
 *
 *  General information
 *   - Input to all API functions are (x,y,w) clip-space coordinates (x positive left, y positive up, w positive away from camera).
 *     We entirely skip the z component and instead compute it as 1 / w, see next bullet. For TestRect the input is NDC (x/w, y/w).
 *   - We use a simple z = 1 / w transform, which is a bit faster than OGL/DX depth transforms. Thus, depth is REVERSED and z = 0 at
 *     the far plane and z = inf at w = 0. We also have to use a GREATER depth function, which explains why all the conservative
 *     tests will be reversed compared to what you might be used to (for example zMaxTri >= zMinBuffer is a visibility test)
 *   - We support different layouts for vertex data (basic AoS and SoA), but note that it's beneficial to store the position data
 *     as tightly in memory as possible to reduce cache misses. Big strides are bad, so it's beneficial to keep position as a separate
 *     stream (rather than bundled with attributes) or to keep a copy of the position data for the occlusion culling system.
 *   - The resolution width must be a multiple of 8 and height a multiple of 4.
 *   - The hierarchical Z buffer is stored OpenGL-style with the y axis pointing up. This includes the scissor box.
 *   - This code is only tested with Visual Studio 2015, but should hopefully be easy to port to other compilers.
