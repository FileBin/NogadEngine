// This interface is a temporary solution until dx12 driver is stable enough.
// If the game crashes before getting to the menu so that users can change the
// driver setting back to dx11, it'll automatically fall back to "auto",
// and show a popup message next launch.
//
// It's currently implemented in daNetGame games in the DriverFallbackCallback class.
// It counts the number of frames rendered with WorldRenderer, and if the game didn't
// crash within a certain number of frames (10 currently) it considers the game having
// launched successfully.
//
// If the game closes properly, it's also considered a successful start.
// This is to allow users to alt + f4 on the login screen for example.
//
// This feature is enabled by the dx12/previous_run_crash_fallback_enabled
// setting. It's true by default in release builds, false otherwise.
